# BUG: If the LESS definition is instead placed at the bottom of this file
#      it will for some reason have no effect.
# NOTE: For some reason, setting LESS here also enables mouse scroll in tmux
#       for programs that use LESS as a pager (systemctl, etc) that are not
#       listed in the tmux.conf variable $tmux_commands_with_legacy_scroll
#       (even without --mouse --wheel-lines=3 which causes tmux mouse selection
#       to not work).
#       EDIT: systemctrl by default sets LESS to "-FRSXMK" and the -X makes the
#       terminal not use an alternate screen. My tmux config relies on the
#       variable "#{alternate_on}" to determine when to send up/down keys
#       when mouse scrolling which does not get set to true when -X is used.
#       Since the LESS variable here overwrites the LESS variable in the
#       environment, -X is not passed to less despite systemctl setting the
#       environment variable.
# NOTE: For some reason, when LESS is defined here, the usual manpage status
#       bar is not used (even without -M).
# NOTE: Even if LESS is set in the environment, this will overwrite it.
#       Perhaps this is why the manpage status bar is not used if it defines
#       it in the LESS variable instead of as arguments to less.
# FLAGS: -i: smart case search; -R: process colors; -F: quit if fits on screen;
#        -M: show line numbers in status bar; -S: wrap lines.
LESS = -i -R -F -M -S
